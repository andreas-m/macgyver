# MacGyver

Building a better mullet.

Inspired by mullet.io it's a combination of react on the frontend and hapi.js on the backend.

Differences to mullet:

* Built on gulp rather than grunt
* Up to date hapi and react components (hapi v8, react 0.12)
* The react dev tools work
* It works on windows

## Installation

Install node

    git clone https://github.com/stevejhiggs/macgyver

    cd macgyver

    npm install

    npm start

## development

To auto rebuild jsx views during development run:

    gulp

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to see the sample page!

## Other stuff

Macgyver was heavily influenced by mullet (www.mullet.io) and I plan to put some of these fixes back into that (grunt does my head in though)
