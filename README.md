# MacGyver

Building a better mullet.

Inspired by mullet.io it's a combination of react on the frontend and hapi.js on the backend. It started as a simple one off client example
but is no growing to encompass a variety of different examples for people to take apart and play with.

# available examples

* reactClient - the simplest possible implementation of react. Shows how to get the views built and injected client side.
* reactPlusFlux - shows the integration of react with the flux design architecture and how they compliment each other. - credit to @rtomlinson
